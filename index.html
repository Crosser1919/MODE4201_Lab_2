			<h1>Hi I'm Drew Cross</h1>
			<p>
				Hi my name is Drew Cross. I am a third year student at Durham College
				enrolled in the Computer Programming and Analysis program. The purpose
				of this site is to serve as a central hub for my work in the
				<strong>MODE 4201</strong>
				course.
			</p>
			<p>
				A few things to know about me are I am passionate about coding and have
				future aspirations of being a full-stack web-developer. A few of my
				hobbies include working out and sports, playing games, and watching
				shows of pretty much any variety mostly anime. One thing to know about
				me is I am a major fan of the New England Patriots, a team in the NFL.
			</p>
			<p>
				To view some of my technical skills, please see my skills stack below.
				You can see languages I have learned or am currently learning! React.js
				is where I am spending most of my personal time developing my skills.
